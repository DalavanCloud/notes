# Babel Notes

Currently, we do video chat on ~Wednesdays at 9:00 AM EST and 12:00 PM EST (switching between the times every other week)~. We make a PR and then setup a doodle for availability each week (and we make a Slack call for the chat).

If we don't meet, I usually post a summary of what's been going on (notable issues/PRs, etc).

New notes are added as pull requests (watch the repo!): feel free to comment on them!

We also have an archive of the rooms using slackarchive: https://babeljs.slackarchive.io/development/
