> just a WIP to get started

Sorry, I'm not currently interested! I'm looking for a company that cares about the open source community: whether it be donating to important projects that the company uses (like on opencollective.com), contributing developer time during work hours to fix bugs, report issues, even maintain a project, or even doing a matching donation similar to a non-profit (maybe give $50 a month to employees for them to choose). If you have any questions about that I'd be happy to explain.

Thanks!
