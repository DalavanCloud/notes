## Core Meeting

- Agreed on new meeting time!

## Community Meeting

- Sven: idea from firefox devtools team
- We've never tried it before, how many people will show up, is it useful?
- Would be better suited for previous contributors vs. turn into in-person GitHub issues.
- Other examples: [Probot](https://probot.github.io/community/), [Primer](https://spectrum.chat/primer/office-hours)

Let's think about it more.

## Local Meetings

- Are there other open source projects that have meetups like this? Should do some research and ask.
- Can be a contributor workshop/hackathon vs. just "speakers"
- Cooperate with an existing conference/meetup? (So we don't end up making our own meetup)
- Can use some WeWork/company space, or do a workshop at a company?
- Or what about a university/school?

Goals: in-person seems more effective to bring people in. Don't just be a meetup, focus on community building vs. speakers?

## Nicolo's Class PR

- [ ] Need to review! https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/8130

## Podcast!

- Goals: similar to the in-person meetup.
  - Get more contributors into Babel/open source, help against fears of getting involved, potential contributors think everything is done while we believe everything needs help
- Could be interesting to interview multiple kinds of people (not just well-known): whether they are in a different field, new to coding, in another language, or on TC39?
- Talk about our own struggles, day to day development (e.g. why babel 7 took so long, why implementing proposals are hard)
